An EDA Project by Students of AISSMS IOIT, Pune

Project Overview
AI-powered crop recommendation system designed to help farmers make informed decisions about which crops to plant based on soil composition and environmental factors. The system uses machine learning to analyze inputs such as soil NPK values, pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall to recommend the most suitable crop for given conditions.

Features
Intelligent Crop Recommendations: Uses a Random Forest machine learning model to predict suitable crops
Support for 22 Crops: Includes major Indian crops like rice, maize, cotton, various pulses, and fruits
Detailed Crop Information: Provides descriptions and ideal growing conditions for each crop
Responsive Design: Mobile-friendly interface for farmers to access from any device
Simple Input Form: Easy-to-use interface for entering soil and climate parameters
API Access: Programmatic access for integration with other agricultural systems
Technology Stack

Backend: Python with Flask web framework
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn for model training and predictions
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5 for responsive design
Data Processing: Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
